# svxlink

These are the scripts I've created to assist with instaling and configuring svxlink.


Port and protocols needed for an EchoLink node:

- EchoLink requires that inbound UDP ports 5198 and 5199 to your node are passed through. 

- Also, TCP port 22 for Secure Shell to the node will allow you to log into the device remotely to manage it.
